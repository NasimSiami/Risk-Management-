# The Determinants of Selective Hedging


## 1. Introduction and Motivation

Selective hedging involves actively adjusting the size and timing of derivative transactions based on a firm’s market views. While firms claim to use derivatives only for hedging, selective hedging introduces speculative motives that may or may not add value for shareholders.

This research evaluates the conditions under which firms engage in selective hedging, focusing on the gold mining industry—a sector ideal for this study due to the transparency of hedging practices and globally integrated pricing.

## 2. Literature Review

### 2.1 Speculation, Firm Size, and Bankruptcy Risk

- Smaller firms are more likely to speculate than larger firms, contradicting the expectation that information advantages lie with larger firms.
- Speculation is positively correlated with financial distress indicators like Altman’s Z-score.
- Increased speculation is associated with higher stock return volatility.

### 2.2 Governance and Compensation

- Firms with larger boards tend to speculate more.
- No strong evidence was found linking speculation to CEO/CFO compensation structures or stock option sensitivity (vega).
- Weak governance links suggest speculation is more behavioral than incentive-driven.

## 3. Empirical Observations

- Managers frequently adjust hedging ratios in response to market views.
- A survey among gold producers confirms that market outlook significantly affects hedging decisions.
- Anecdotal evidence shows gold prices respond to major producers’ hedging announcements, indicating perceived informational advantages.

## 4. Robustness Checks

- Results hold under alternative measures of speculation and information advantage (e.g., gold reserves, firm age, CEO tenure).
- Findings are consistent across different time periods, including a 2002–2011 gold price surge.

## 5. Behavioral Considerations

- Managers at smaller firms may mistakenly believe they have an informational edge.
- Behavioral biases, such as overconfidence, appear to drive speculative derivative use.
- Gender diversity and internal board dynamics may influence risk-taking in future research.

## 6. Conclusion

- Selective hedging often increases financial risk and volatility.
- No significant evidence was found that speculation adds shareholder value.
- This behavior may reflect behavioral biases rather than rational financial decisions.
